# How This Site Is Built 🏗

This is a _public Foam workspace_. Yes, [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam)

As written on the [project `readme.md`](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/readme.md):

> **Foam** is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), built on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
>
> You can use **Foam** for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.
>
> **Foam** is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you're free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.

This front end comes from [foam-gatsby-template](https://github.com/mathieudutour/foam-gatsby-template), and I've opted to host on Netlify instead of GitHub Pages. In fact, the [deploy logs for this site](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mlaws-thoughts/deploys/) are totally public 🚀
