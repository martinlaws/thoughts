# Mindfulness

At present, my mindfulness practice is centered in:

- mindful meditation
- one-pointed concentration meditation
- at-home yoga

In Search Inside Yourself (see: [[reading]]), Jon Kabat-Zinn is quotes as defining mindfulness as:

> Paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.

I cannot think of a more attainable practice than that.
