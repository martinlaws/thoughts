# Welcome üëãüèª

Hey there, welcome to Martin's `thoughts`, also known as my _public Foam bubble_. The easiest way to navigate this is via the map in the top-right corner.

[[todo]]: improve this tl;dr

## Foam ü§î

Yes, [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam).

As written on the [project `readme.md`](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/readme.md):

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation workspace](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.
2. Press "Use this template" button at [foam-gatsby-template](https://github.com/mathieudutour/foam-gatsby-template/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.
3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.

    *Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item. In VS Code, "open workspace" refers to [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).*

4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)
5. Open [_layouts/gatsby-config.js](_layouts/gatsby-config.js) and edit the `pathPrefix` to be the name of the repository.

## Why

This repo encapsulates my efforts to test a few hypotheses concurrently:

1. Writing my thoughts down will help me practice:

   - focus
   - mindfulness
   - slowing down

1. Sharing more of my thoughts in public will benefit myself and at least a few people around me
1. Using an open-source tool every day will enocourage me to contribute back in a meaningful way

   - [x] contribute to Foam docs
   - [ ] help develop Foam on Gatsby

1. `Foam` could be a perfect replacement for:
   - Shitty + often-expensive notetaking software
   - A blog for my website
   - Ten-thread tweets that probably shouldn't be tweets - [follow me](https://twitter.com/martinblaws) anyway

## Getting started

The following are my recommended entrypoints to this somewhat organized chaos:

- [[about]]
- [[core-principles]]

## Note on this repo

‚ö†Ô∏è As is clear from the repo title - these files represent my barely-structured thoughts. Some will be more fully-formed than others. My career so far has been rooted in prototyping - being scrappy and resourceful, building quickly, and iterating often. I am applying the same approach to this repo. If there's anything in here that you percieve as problematic, unincluisive, in conflict with my stated [[core-principles]], or straight-up wrong: **please let me know**! You're welcome to open a [GitHub issue on this repo](https://github.com/martinlaws/thoughts/issues/new) if you feel comfortable doing so publicly, or send me a private email at [mlaws@hey.com](mailto:mlaws@hey.com).
