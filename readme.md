# Welcome to my digital garden üå±

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2cfc85ea-e8a8-46ec-8a1c-4d074687fa27/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mlaws-thoughts/deploys)

I'm [[Martin]], an internet tinkerer lucky enough to design with code for a living.

The majority of my [[work]] is scrappy, resourceful, collaborative, iterative prototyping. This site is my attempt to apply the same approach to my writing. I'm hardly concerned with the final "showpiece", much more interested in exploring the process, care and craft it takes to get there.

## This blog is not a blog

In his digital garden, [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) writes:

This is my space, for me, in public. I have a private space, but what's the fun in a digital garden if you can't share the resulting veggies with your friends?

## No tracking, clickbait, or bullshit

This site is 100% free of Google Analytics, automatic indexing, search engine optimization, tracking cookies, monetization, advertising, or any other evil nonsense. I know how this shit works, I used to build it (see: [[work]]).

## Who this is for

The primary audience for this site is future Martin. I love being able to `cmd + f` my notes/thoughts, and will default to sharing them publicly. As such, I'll mostly be sharing thoughts freeform with minimal organization/structure.

The secondary audience for this site is my friends and family. I predict that it will be a little bit easier to share resources, notes, videos, recipes, just about everything, in this format. I'm going to share early and often.

As such, I'm not going to wait to form ideas perfectly before sharing - I'll plant little seedlings, nuturing them as I go (and losing some along the way).

‚ö†Ô∏è If there's anything in here that you percieve as problematic, unincluisive, in conflict with my own [[core-principles]], or straight-up wrong: **please let me know**! You're welcome to open a [GitHub issue on this repo](https://github.com/martinlaws/thoughts/issues/new) if you feel comfortable doing so publicly, or send me a [private email](mailto:mlaws@hey.com).

## Curation and relationships > indexing and file paths

I'm no information architect. I am sold on a different way of navigating content: curation and relationships (links). I'll curate links to other pages thoughtfully (see: the vewry next section). You can explore those links in two ways:

1. The _Link Map_ accessible by clicking on the blue icon in the top-right corner of [this page](https://thoughts.mlaws.ca)
2. The _Referenced in_ section on the bottom of each page (auto-generated)

## How I built this üèó

This is a _public Foam workspace_. Yes, [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam)

![Dr. Evil sipping a latte and leaving foam on his nose](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4qF2b3IfBA78eRhct/giphy.gif)

As written on the [project `readme.md`](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/readme.md):

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation workspace](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.
2. Press "Use this template" button at [foam-gatsby-template](https://github.com/mathieudutour/foam-gatsby-template/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.
3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.

    *Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item. In VS Code, "open workspace" refers to [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).*

4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)
5. Open [_layouts/gatsby-config.js](_layouts/gatsby-config.js) and edit the `pathPrefix` to be the name of the repository.
=======
> **Foam** is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), built on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
>
> You can use **Foam** for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.
>
> **Foam** is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you're free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.

## Why I built this ü§î

This project encapsulates my efforts to test a few hypotheses concurrently:

1. Writing my thoughts down will help me practice:

   - focus
   - mindfulness
   - slowing down

2. Sharing more of my thoughts in public will benefit myself and at least a few people around me
3. Using an open-source tool every day will enocourage me to contribute back in a meaningful way

   - [x] contribute to Foam docs
   - [ ] help develop Foam on Gatsby

4. `Foam` could be a perfect replacement for:
   - Shitty + often-expensive notetaking software
   - A blog for my website
   - Ten-thread tweets that probably shouldn't be tweets - [follow me](https://twitter.com/martinblaws) anyway
