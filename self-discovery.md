## Why I built this ðŸ¤”

This project encapsulates my efforts to test a few hypotheses concurrently:

1. Writing my thoughts down will help me practice:

   - focus
   - mindfulness
   - slowing down

2. Sharing more of my thoughts in public will benefit myself and at least a few people around me
3. Using an open-source tool every day will enocourage me to contribute back in a meaningful way

   - [x] contribute to Foam docs
   - [ ] help develop Foam on Gatsby

4. `Foam` could be a perfect replacement for:
   - Shitty + often-expensive notetaking software
   - A blog for my website
   - Ten-thread tweets that probably shouldn't be tweets - [follow me](https://twitter.com/martinblaws) anyway
