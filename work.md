# Work

This page is a collection of thoughts on work, my career so far, what I do and how I do it. For a more structured look at my work experience, [have a look at my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinlaws/). For more about me as a human, check out [[Martin]].

## What I do

I'm a serial prototyper, developer, designer, and team-builder. I tend to view my work as _designing with code_. In my experience, UX developers wear a lot of hats, from early-stage product strategy and design thinking through production engineering. I love the interdisciplinary nature of my craft, and am currently exploring where I want to deepen my area of practice.

## Where I work

I'm a Senior UX Developer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com). I work on features for Shopify Partners and partner developers, and do lots of work on [shopify.com](https://www.shopify.com). Previously, I founded [[low-tide]], where I was fortunate to work with clients including [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/), [Vote Compass](https://votecompass.com/), [Lighthouse Labs](https://lighthouselabs.ca), and many more. I'm terrible at sitting still and have always embraced the side hustle. For the first time, my side hustle is [[self-discovery]].
