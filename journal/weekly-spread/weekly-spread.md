# Weekly Spread

The [weekly spread](https://littlecoffeefox.com/5-weekly-bullet-journal-spreads/) is a bullet journal technique that I have been using for the past couple of years. I've found it incredibly helpful in setting priorities and intentions in the context of a week. I think weeks are wonderful units of measurement for measuring objectives: long enough to make progress but short enough to make procrastination hard to get away with.

Create a weekly spread using the [[weekly-template]].

[[journal]]
